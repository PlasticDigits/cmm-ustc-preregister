# USTC Preregistration DApp Logo Image Prompt

## Main Prompt

A minimalist, modern logo for a USTC (Terra Classic) preregistration swap DApp. The logo features a stylized letter "U" integrated with blockchain/swap elements. The design uses a dark, sleek aesthetic with brilliant gold (#FFD700) and cyan (#00D4FF) gradient accents on a deep black (#0a0a0a) background. The "U" shape is formed by two interconnected crescent arcs that suggest token flow and exchange, with subtle geometric blockchain node patterns integrated into the curves. The gold-to-cyan gradient flows from top-left to bottom-right, creating a sense of movement and transaction. Clean, professional, scalable vector-style design suitable for use as a favicon, app icon, and header logo. No text, icon-only mark. High contrast, works well on both light and dark backgrounds with optional white outline variant.

## Alternative Detailed Prompts

### Option 1: Symbol-Focused
A geometric logo icon combining a stylized "U" letterform with swap/blockchain symbolism. Two curved bands forming a "U" shape, with the left curve in brilliant gold (#FFD700) and the right curve in vibrant cyan (#00D4FF), meeting at the bottom in a seamless gradient blend. The curves contain subtle interconnected chain link patterns suggesting blockchain transactions. Dark background (#0a0a0a) with soft radial glow emanating from the symbol. Minimalist, modern, scalable design with sharp edges and smooth curves. Professional DeFi aesthetic.

### Option 2: Token-Focused
A circular badge-style logo featuring a stylized "U" monogram in the center, surrounded by a ring of interconnected tokens/coins. The "U" is rendered in a gold-to-cyan gradient (#FFD700 to #00D4FF), with the tokens in the ring alternating between gold and cyan accents. Dark background with subtle grid pattern suggesting blockchain technology. Clean, professional, suitable for favicon use. Vector illustration style with precise linework.

### Option 3: Minimalist Wordmark-Symbol Hybrid
A horizontal logo combining a symbolic icon with text. The icon is a streamlined "U" shape formed by two parallel curves - one gold (#FFD700), one cyan (#00D4FF) - connected at the base by a horizontal bridge suggesting a swap bridge. The curves have subtle geometric facets suggesting blockchain blocks. Next to it, the text "USTC" in sleek, modern sans-serif font with the same gold-to-cyan gradient fill. Dark background (#0a0a0a). Professional, clean, DeFi aesthetic.
