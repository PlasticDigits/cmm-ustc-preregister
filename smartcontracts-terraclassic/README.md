# USTC Preregister - Terra Classic Smart Contract

This is a CosmWasm smart contract for handling USTC deposits, withdrawals, and user enumeration on Terra Classic.

## Overview

The contract allows users to:
- Deposit native USTC tokens
- Withdraw their deposited USTC tokens
- Query their deposit balance
- Enumerate all users and their deposits

The contract owner can:
- Withdraw all accumulated USTC tokens
- Update contract configuration

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Docker (for contract optimization)
- Terra Classic CLI (`terrad`) - for deployment

## Setup

1. **Install Rust** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository** (if not already cloned):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cmm-ustc-preregister/smartcontracts-terraclassic
   ```

3. **Build the contract**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts/ustc-preregister
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
cd contracts/ustc-preregister
cargo test
```

All tests should pass. The test suite includes:
- Instantiation tests
- Deposit tests (including error cases)
- Withdraw tests (including error cases)
- Owner withdrawal tests
- Query tests (user deposits, all users, user count, total deposits, config)

## Building Optimized Contract

Before deploying, you need to build an optimized version of the contract:

```bash
cd smartcontracts-terraclassic
./scripts/optimize.sh
```

This will create an optimized WASM file in the `artifacts/` directory.

## Generating Schemas

To generate JSON schemas for the contract:

```bash
cd contracts/ustc-preregister
cargo run --example schema
```

The schemas will be generated in the `schema/` directory.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites for Deployment

1. Install `terrad` (Terra Classic CLI)
2. Configure your key with `terrad keys add <key-name>`
3. Fund your account with LUNA for gas fees

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
cd smartcontracts-terraclassic
./scripts/deploy.sh testnet <your-terra-address> uusd
```

Follow the instructions provided by the script.

### Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
cd smartcontracts-terraclassic
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet <your-terra-address> uusd
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Only deploy to mainnet after thorough testing on testnet!

## Contract Functions

### Instantiate

```rust
{
  "owner": "terra1..."
}
```

Note: The USTC denomination is hardcoded to "uusd" and cannot be changed.

### Execute Messages

#### Deposit
```rust
{
  "deposit": {}
}
```
Sends native USTC tokens with the message.

#### Withdraw
```rust
{
  "withdraw": {
    "amount": "1000"
  }
}
```

#### Owner Withdraw
```rust
{
  "owner_withdraw": {}
}
```
Only callable by the contract owner.

#### Update Config
```rust
{
  "update_config": {
    "owner": "terra1..." // optional
  }
}
```
Only callable by the contract owner.

### Query Messages

#### Get User Deposit
```rust
{
  "get_user_deposit": {
    "user": "terra1..."
  }
}
```

#### Get All Users
```rust
{
  "get_all_users": {
    "start_after": "terra1...", // Optional: user address to start pagination after
    "limit": 30                   // Optional: maximum number of results (default: 30, max: 100)
  }
}
```

Returns a paginated list of all users and their deposits. The response includes:
- `users`: Array of `(address, deposit)` tuples
- `next`: Optional cursor (user address) for the next page. If `None`, there are no more users.

Example pagination flow:
1. First query: `{"get_all_users": {"limit": 30}}` → Returns first 30 users, `next` contains cursor
2. Next query: `{"get_all_users": {"start_after": "<cursor>", "limit": 30}}` → Returns next 30 users

#### Get User Count
```rust
{
  "get_user_count": {}
}
```

#### Get Total Deposits
```rust
{
  "get_total_deposits": {}
}
```

#### Get Config
```rust
{
  "get_config": {}
}
```

#### Validate Index
```rust
{
  "validate_index": {}
}
```

Validates the consistency of the index storage system. Returns:
- `is_consistent`: Boolean indicating if all checks passed
- `issues`: Array of strings describing any issues found
- `user_count_stored`: The stored user count value
- `user_count_actual`: The actual number of users with non-zero balances
- `total_users_in_index`: Total entries in the index storage

This query is useful for debugging and ensuring data integrity.

## State Management

The contract uses an efficient index-based storage system for user enumeration:

- **User Storage**: `Map<&Addr, Uint128>` - O(1) lookup for user deposits
- **Index Storage**: `Map<u32, Addr>` and `Map<&Addr, u32>` - Efficient enumeration without loading entire user list
- **User Count**: `Item<u32>` - O(1) query for total user count
- **Index Maintenance**: When a user withdraws all funds and is removed, the last user is swapped to fill the gap, maintaining compact indices
- **Total Deposits**: `Item<Uint128>` - Tracks sum of all user deposits

This design supports 100k+ users efficiently and prevents gas issues from loading large arrays.

### Total Deposits vs Contract Balance

**Important Note**: The `total_deposits` value represents the sum of all user deposits tracked through the `Deposit` function. It does NOT necessarily equal the contract's actual USTC balance in the following scenarios:

1. **External Transfers**: If USTC tokens are sent directly to the contract address (not via the `Deposit` function), they will increase the contract balance but NOT the `total_deposits` counter. The owner can still withdraw these funds via `OwnerWithdraw`.

2. **Unaccounted Balance**: This allows the contract to handle edge cases like:
   - Accidental direct transfers
   - Airdrops
   - Refunds from other contracts
   - Any other mechanism that deposits USTC without using the `Deposit` function

3. **Withdrawals**: When users withdraw, both `total_deposits` and the contract balance decrease. When the owner withdraws, only the contract balance decreases (not `total_deposits`), as the owner can withdraw any accumulated balance.

**Use Cases**:
- `total_deposits`: Use this to track how much users have deposited through the contract interface
- Contract balance (via queries): Use this to know the actual USTC amount available for owner withdrawal

The `ValidateIndex` query can help verify that the sum of individual user deposits matches `total_deposits` for validation purposes.

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling:

- `Unauthorized` - Only owner can call owner-only functions
- `InvalidAmount` - Amount must be greater than zero
- `InsufficientBalance` - User does not have enough balance to withdraw
- `InvalidDenom` - Wrong token denomination provided
- `UserNotFound` - User not found (for queries)
- `NoBalanceToWithdraw` - Contract has no balance for owner withdrawal
- `IndexInconsistency` - Index storage corruption detected (should not occur in normal operation)
- `StartAfterUserNotFound` - Pagination cursor user not found in index
- `IndexConversionFailed` - Index conversion error (theoretical, unlikely in practice)

## Security Considerations

- Access control: Owner-only functions are protected
- Input validation: All amounts are validated (> 0)
- Denomination validation: Only the configured USTC denomination is accepted
- Balance checks: Users cannot withdraw more than they deposited
- Index consistency: Index corruption is detected and reported with explicit errors
- Error handling: Comprehensive error messages for debugging
